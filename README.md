This repository demonstrates a common data race bug in Rust when using raw pointers with vectors. The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code, which modifies a vector's contents via a raw pointer without proper synchronization. This can lead to undefined behavior and data corruption. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version that avoids the data race by using safe Rust techniques.  It highlights the importance of avoiding raw pointer manipulation of vectors unless absolutely necessary and adhering to Rust's ownership and borrowing rules for thread safety.
